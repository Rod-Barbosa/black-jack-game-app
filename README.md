## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to Code/Understand:

- arrays
- objects
- booleans
- if else statements
- comparison operators
- logical operators
- for loops
- The Math object
- return statements

## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS 
- JavaScript


### What I learned

Very good review/introductory course to basic javascript concepts

Littel detail about the startGame() function. It has this name for human reading. On the backend, startGame just calls renderGame() after setting initial variables:

```html
<button onclick="startGame()">START GAME</button>
```
```js
function startGame() {
    isAlive = true
    let firstCard = getRandomCard()
    let secondCard = getRandomCard()
    cards = [firstCard, secondCard]
    sum = firstCard + secondCard
    renderGame()
}
```

The getRandomCard() function uses a trick that can only be used when the lowest random value is 1
```js
    let randomNumber = Math.floor( Math.random()*13 ) + 1
```
For random values normally the formula is: 

```js
function randomNumGenerator (min, max){
  return Math.floor( Math.random()*(max-min+1) + min)
}
```

### Continued development

Very interesting way of teaching ht efundamentals. Maybe in the future I'll come back and code a betting function? To increase money or decrease accordinly. Let's see. As it stands, the game is sufficiently complex for what I'm reviewing.

### Useful resources
